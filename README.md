This is a simple Android project that demonstrates the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture pattern. The goal of this project is to showcase how MVP can be implemented to separate concerns, make the app more modular and testable and make MVP more understandible for beginners.
The Codes are seperated as well
If you are a beginner, I suggest you start by reading the Model, then the Contract, and finally the Presenter.

Just Clone it And Enjoy my Friend !!!
